# RPN Calculator in Ruby

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation where the operator follows the operand. For example, the expression '5 + 3' could be written in RPN as '5 3 +'. In both forms, the result would be '8'.

The following video provides a great overview of how an RPN calculator works: [https://youtu.be/7ha78yWRDlE](https://youtu.be/7ha78yWRDlE)  

This program implements a basic RPN Calculator. As a user types numbers and operators into the terminal, the result is evaluated.
